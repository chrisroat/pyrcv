    """Convert a :class:`pyrcv.types.RaceResult` into data needed for a Sankey diagram.

    A Sankey diagram consists of nodes and links between nodes. Links have
    a value denoting the flow from the source node to the target node. The
    value of a node is the sum of flows into the node minus the flows out
    of the node.

    In a Sankey diagram visualizing an RCV election, there is a node for each candidate
    in each round.  Nodes are associated with a round, have a color, and are labelled
    by their candidate.  Node indexes for a given round/candidate are show in the
    following table:

    .. code-block:: text

                cand_0   cand_1  ...   cand_n-1
                ------  -------       ---------
        round_0:     0,       1, ...,   ncand-1
        round_1: ncand, ncand+1, ..., 2*ncand-1
        ... etc ...

    Links are between nodes in consecutive rounds, and denote how many votes flow
    from one candidate to another - including votes a candidate keeps for themself.  A
    link has a source and a target.  By default, it is colored with the same hue as the
    node it starts from, but with lighter saturation.

    :param race_result: Result of a single RCV race.
    :param hide_exhausted: If True, do not include counts of exhausted ballots,
        Defaults to False.
    :param node_palette: Colors to use for nodes in Sankey diagram.  Should match
        in hue to link_palette.  If there are more candidates then colors, the
        palette is cycled.  Defaults to :const:`NODE_PALETTE`.
    :param link_palette: Colors to use for links between nodes in Sankey diagram.
        Should match in hue to node_palette.  If there are more candidates then colors,
        the palette is cycled.  Defaults to :const:`LINK_PALETTE`.
